# Ruby-CLI-Logger

The idea is that this will be a super simple command line utility for logging short bits of text.

Ideally, there will also eventually be a way to push notes from rcl into Evernote, Simplenote or email.

# Requirements

* sequel
* rspec (to run the tests)

# Usage

So far, all it does is log, like so:

     $ rcl log "Don't forget this."
